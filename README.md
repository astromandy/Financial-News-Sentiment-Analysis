# üí¨ Financial Sentiment Analysis System

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive **financial sentiment analysis system** using both classical machine learning algorithms and advanced transformer-based NLP models. The goal is to classify financial news into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** sentiments to support investment decisions and market analysis.

---

## üß† Sentiment Classification Framework

- **Positive**: Optimistic news likely to influence the market favorably  
- **Neutral**: Factual content with no emotional weight  
- **Negative**: Pessimistic news likely to negatively impact the market

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodological Approaches

### Classical ML Models
- Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF Vectorization
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Advanced NLP Techniques
- **VADER**: Rule-based sentiment analyzer optimized for social/short financial texts
- **Transformers**:
  - **RoBERTa**: Robust version of BERT
  - **FinBERT**: Domain-specific model trained on financial text

---

## üßπ Text Preprocessing

- Text normalization (lowercasing)
- Noise removal (punctuation, special chars)
- Stop word removal
- Lemmatization
- Tokenization

---

## üìä Evaluation Strategy

- Confusion Matrices
- Accuracy Scores
- Precision, Recall, F1-score per class
- Comparative analysis of classical vs. transformer-based models

---

## üß™ Model Strengths

### Classical ML
- Efficient, interpretable
- Suitable for large and sparse datasets

### Lexicon-based (VADER)
- No training required
- Transparent scoring and domain adaptability

### Transformer-based
- Deep contextual understanding
- Superior performance in financial contexts (e.g., FinBERT)
- Handles nuance and linguistic complexity

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges in Financial Sentiment

- **Domain specificity**: Contextual and ambiguous terminology
- **Implicit sentiment**: Lack of explicit positive/negative words
- **Temporal influence**: Varies with market conditions
- **Subtlety**: Complex syntax and negation handling

---

## üíº Applications

- Market sentiment dashboards
- Automated news summarization
- Risk flagging systems
- Trading signal enhancements
- Financial trend analysis
